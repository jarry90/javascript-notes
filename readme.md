## Varliable naming convention
1. give code variables meaningful names
2. cannot begin with a number
3. cant contain spaces
4. abc123$_ only
5. camel casing

## Strings
1. can be joined using +
2. **string.length #returns lenght of the string**
3. **string.slice(x,y) #slices out variable from position x to (but not including) y. Index starts at 0**
